# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Multiple machine learning classifiers are employed to predict fraudulent activity. To address the class imbalance issue inherent in fraud detection, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is incorporated to augment the training data and improve model performance.

## Features
- Input a list of classifiers to evaluate their performance.
- SMOTE integration to handle class imbalance.
- Model training and evaluation on imbalanced datasets.
- Easy to extend with additional classifiers or techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
